            <h2>My Story</h2>

            <p>My story has evolved quite a bit. When I was younger, I wanted nothing more than to continue my path in residential housing management and eventually start my own real estate company. Then I did what most young girls dream to do and fell in love, not with just any man, but with a Soldier. Since then, we have moved five times, had two amazing children, bought our first and forever (maybe?) home, and so much more. My dreams have changed a little over this time, and that's okay.</p>

            <p>My husband coined the term "Walker Adventures" early on in our marriage. In true Army fashion, we were on the road to our first move 12 days after my son was born. During this trip, we ended up driving through the Ohio River Valley in a snow storm while towing my husband's car behind and with our two large breed dogs in the car with us. The "adventure" came in when a tire blew out in the middle of the storm and we had to figure out how to get someplace safe with all of our baggage, literally and figuratively. This was only the first of many situations like this. I'll share one more story. I'm sure you've heard of Chicken Little and the sky falling, but my ceiling actually did fall. We lived in Germany where my husband delployed from last, and the plaster from the ceiling in my son's room fell to the ground. It actually fell...like half of his ceiling was on the floor. Thankfully, we weren't home at the time or there could have been a much different outcome. Over these many years, there have been too many other memorable stories just like these for me to have space to share here. </p>

            <p>Why is all of this important, though? Well, all of this has made me the person I am today. Without the many moves and the necessity to keep things so organized, I may not be the organized person I am today. Without all of the unbelievable experiences, I probably would not be the critical thinker and problem solver that I am now. Without the necessity to change jobs at least every 2-3 years, I may not have stumbled upon the path that led me here. It was at the suggestion of a friend that I look into teaching, and if it weren't for that suggestion, I would have never gotten experience with computer science to find my true passion.</p>

            <h2>My New Dream</h2>

            <p>I teach students how to use various forms of technology, including Google apps and Microsoft Office. Teaching has also introcuded me to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for game development through Code.org's curriculum. I think logically, so once I learn a new code, I turn it over in my mind until it makes sense, and I connect it with previous knowledge if possible. As a teacher, not only do I teach students but I help my coworkers with technology, from trouble shooting why the projector isn't working to helping them build content in and navigate Canvas. I didn't realize it until my dad passed away a few years ago, but he is the reason I am so gifted in this area. My dad was an audiovisual tech in the Marine Corps. He was always tinkering with something or another. Sometimes it was technology, other times it his car or even building things. The skills that he taught me and demonstrated over his life have impacted mine in such a profound way.</p>
            
            <p>So many of my greatest skills align directly with the skills needed for programming. Way back when I worked in residential property management, my job as the leasing manager was to prepare lease agreements and to review those that other leasing agents created. I realized then that I have extremely high attention to detail, and I still do; I am able to look at code and quickly spot the error causing the bug. I built great working relationshis with community partners when I worked for Army Community Service. Teamwork is an essential skill for a programmer, and really any career. As a budget analyst and as a bookkeeper, I never shied away from the hard work or questions to really analyze where funds would best be used and where cost savings could be achieved. I won't stop until the code is error-free and is the best it can be. Two years ago when developing and refining the curriculum for a new course with two other teachers, we worked synergistically to lead and revise the content so it could be best used by teachers. I am always looking for ways to make things better with a focus on the end user. These are my strengths. </p>

            <h2>The Future</h2>

            <p>I don't yet know enough to become a software engineer, but I know I can learn. I have gained a comfortable introductory-level knowledge of HTML and CSS, and a very introductory-level of knowledge of JavaScript for game develoment. I don't quite understand how to make the connection from what I know about JavaScript to making it work on a webpage, which is why you don't see any here now. </p>

            <p> As I write this, the deadline for a 4-month intensive coding program that I will be applying for is approaching quickly. I am hopeful that I will be accepted; I truly enjoy working with technology and writing code. However, if this program does not work out, I will be pursuing a masters in software development. I have also started going through the JavaScript lessons  available on<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp.org.</a> I really am a lifelong learner, and I look forward to the journey ahead.</p>
            
            <p>Life is busy, but I am trying to put more of a focus on maintaining and growing my professional netwowrk. This week, my focus is on updating my current SMART goal and writing a new one. If you need a refresher on SMART goals or want to do this along with me, check out Kat Boogaard's article<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals"target="blank"> here.</a> I also hope to find more time to do more of what I love.</p>
