            <h2>My Story</h2>

            <p>My story has evolved quite a bit. Years ago, I wanted nothing more than to continue my path in residential housing management and eventually start my own real estate company. Then I did what most young girls dream to do and fell in love, not with just any man, but with a Soldier. Since then, we have moved five times, had two amazing children, bought our first and forever (maybe?) home, and so much more.</p>

            <p>My husband coined the term "Walker Adventures" early on in our marriage. In true Army fashion, we were on the road to our first move 12 days after my son was born. During this trip, we ended up driving through the Ohio River Valley in a snow storm while towing my husband's car behind and with our two large breed dogs in the car with us. The "adventure" came in when a tire blew out in the middle of the storm and we had to figure out how to get someplace safe with all of our baggage, literally and figuratively. This was only the first of many situations like this. I'll share one more story. I'm sure you've heard of Chicken Little and the sky falling, but my ceiling actually did fall. We lived in Germany where my husband delplyed from last, and the plaster from the ceiling in my son's room fell to the ground. Thankfully, we weren't home at the time or there could have been a much different outcome. Over these many years, there have been too many other memorable stories just like these for me to have space to share here. </p>

            <p>Why is all of this important, though? Well, all of this has made me the person I am today. Without the many moves and the necessity to keep things so organized, I may not be the organized person I am today. Without all of the unbelievable experiences, I probably would not be the critical thinker and problem solver that I am now. Without the necessity to change jobs at least every 2-3 years, I may not have stumbled upon the path that led me here. It was at the suggestion of a friend that I look into teaching, and if it weren't for that suggestion, I would have never gotten experience with computer science to find that I enjoy it so much.</p>

            <h2>Why coding?</h2>

            <p>So many of my greatest skills align directly with the skills needed for coding. Way back when I worked in residential property management, my job as the leasing manager was to prepare lease agreements and to review those that other leasing agents created. I realized then that I have extremely high attention to detail, and I still do; I am able to look at code and quickly spot the error causing the bug. I built great working relationshis with community partners when I worked for Army Community Service. Teamwork is an essential skill for a programmer. As a budget analyst and as a bookkeeper, I never shied away from the hard work or questions to really analyze where funds would best be used and where cost savings could be achieved. I won't stop until the code is error-free and is the best it can be. Two years ago when developing and refining the curriculum for a new course with two other teachers, we worked synergistically to lead and revise the content so it could be best used by teachers. I am always looking for ways to make things better with a ocus on the end user. These are my strengths. </p>
